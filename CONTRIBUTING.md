# Contributing

This project is built in NodeJS, with [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction).

## Development

### Quick Start

Make sure to have [NodeJS 20, 22, or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/colecrouter/stardew-save-editor.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Updating Game Assets

Follow [these instructions from the SDV Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Editing_XNB_files#Unpack_game_files) to unpack the game files. Put them in a `content` folder at the root of the project (eg. `content/Characters/Abigail.png`).

Then run `npm run dump`.

If you need assets that aren't copied from that command, you can modify it in `src/dump.ts`.

### Reading the Save File

The save format is somewhat inconsistent (in structure and consistency). My recommendation is to use a website/tool to format the save file into something more readable, then use a text editor to search for the data you need. [Here is a tool for that](https://jsonformatter.org/xml-parser).

## Making Changes

If you want to make a contribution, just make a pull request.

### Code Style

This project uses BiomeJS for linting, and for formatting JS/TS files. Prettier is used for formatting markup files. You can run `npm run check` to check for linting errors, and `npm run format` to format the files.
