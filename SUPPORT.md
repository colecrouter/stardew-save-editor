   - Windows: Right-click -> `Compress to...` -> `ZIP file`
   - macOS: Ctrl-click -> `Compress`
   - Android: Select file -> Press `...` -> `Compress`
   - *(Alternative)* If you can't compress it, rename it to add ".txt" (e.g. `Player_123456` -> `Player_123456.txt`)
3. Upload the file into the textbox in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/colecrouter/stardew-save-editor/issues).

> Thanks for your cooperation. Without your save file, it can be difficult/impossible to debug certain issues.

## Platform Compatibility

The save editor is designed to work with the desktop (PC/macOS) version of Stardew Valley. However, it may be possible to use the editor with other versions of the game (assuming they are updated to the latest major version). The following steps outline how to use the editor with the console versions.

### Android

> TODO: add detailed instructions/links

### Nintendo Switch

Follow the steps outlined in this page from the [Stardew Valley Wiki on transferring your save from NSW](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves#Nintendo_Switch).

No extra steps are required.

### PlayStation 4
